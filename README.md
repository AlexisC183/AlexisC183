**Hello, fellow GitHuber!**

I really like programming and I'm about to turn into a software developer.

My favourite programming paradigm is purely functional programming, that is, writing code with no statements, only expressions, because statements are meant to perform side effects.
I value the predictability this programming paradigm offers, because other paradigms like OOP rely on states that may differ from one object to another, letting potential errors to happen.
I also like object-oriented programming when generic programming or duck typing is available.

Here is a list of my dominant programming languages as of January 2025:
## Java
I started learning this language because I wanted to develop a game but I ended using it for back-end development. I really appreciate the ease of compressing binaries into JAR files and being able to use them in different operating systems without the risk of they being flagged as malware. I may use this language for developing command-line applications.
## C\#
My first programming language; it was taught in my university. I focused on this language because I wanted to learn game development with Unity but currently I want to use it for cross-platform desktop development. This language is so elegant...
## Python
I learned this language plus with a framework because I will likely to be asked to use them in university. I may use this language for maybe CLI or web development in the future.
## JavaScript
I don't remember what originally motivated me to learn this language, maybe my completion of the HTML-CSS-JS stack. ES6 JavaScript changed my vision of this language recently, I wish I was aware of it earlier. I will need this language for mobile app development, I want to learn React Native.
## SQL
Having seen this language in high-school helped me a lot in university. Currently I am using it to call stored procedures from a web app. The future of me using this language is uncertain, I'm thinking on using a NoSQL database.
## Clojure
My enjoyment towards functional programming started after learning the Java Stream API (thank you, Indian person). By the time I was diving more into this paradigm, I was drawn to the syntax of Lisp. After facing limitations and concerns of writing purely functional code in some of my other languages, I decided to \'migrate\' to a mainly-functional programming language; Clojure is the one that gave me hype the most. I want to use this language for full-stack development, my favourite field of software development. I hope I get a job where Clojure is widely used, in the future.
